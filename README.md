# Tuckahoe Ase  

## Game Design  


2:20 pm - 3:30 pm, 10/04 - 11/08 (11/15 makeup day) --6 weeks total  

This class will be treated as Game Design ASE, with a focus on computer science/programming concepts.  

## Day One  

Since we have a range of grades (3-5). The first day will be an assessment for which direction the class will go in. Due to logistics, the *plugged in* content will be with the iPads.  

### Introductions  
*10 min*  
* Tech Em Studios   
* Any experience with coding  
* What the class is: Game Design
* What we will learn  
  - How to design games  
  - Concepts of coding  

### Computer Program  

*5 min*  

What is a computer program? Simply instructions written by humans carried out by computers. Discuss difference between Hardware and Software.  

### Out-of-Seat Programming Exercise  

*5 - 10 min*

Pick four volunteers to form two groups. Each group has a designated programmer and robot. Have each group stand in same area of the classroom. Point out a place in the room to be a destination. Explain that the programmer needs to give their robot step-by-step to get to the destination by telling the robot to walk forward (x amount of steps) or turn (90 degrees, left or right). The robot can only follow the directions given by their programmer.  

```  
Go Forward 3 steps  
Turn left 90 degrees
Go forward 5 steps  
etc.  
```  
Ask the class, which group was more efficient.  

### How Computers Manage Information   

*15 - 20 min*  

The language computers *speak* is binary, using only the digits 0 and 1. Zero is "coded" to mean OFF, one is "coded" to mean ON. Relate to a light switch.

Use the whiteboard to explain how computers translate numbers we use, decimal number system into the binary number system --by explaining the difference between the two by focusing on the place values.  

Ask for five volunteers. Give each volunteer a big binary flashcard (dark side of cards facing the class). Arrange the students to be in correct place value order. Write the number one on the board, use the cards and input from the class to have each volunteer flip the correct cards (turn "ON") to collectively show the number, one in binary. Do this for the numbers, 2 - 10. The class should progressively get quicker.  

### Computational Thinking  

The use of this concept not only involves computer science/programming, but to a range of subjects; specifically for this class, designing games. When Hyperpad is underway, discuss with the class that everything in the game is an object. Relate to real world objects. Objects are a part of larger classes. Some objects will have similar properties, so we can reuse them (or duplicate) to keep from starting whole objects from scratch. Objects can be a part of the same class, only differ in small characteristics.  

* Decompose  
  - break a  problem into smaller parts  

* Pattern Recognition  
  - look for familiar things  
  - spot the patterns, put the patterns in a reusable form to not unnecessarily repeat yourself (or don't reinvent the wheel)  

### Design Thinking  

*15 min*  

Ask the class what some of their favorite games are; what makes them fun. Explain that we'll use that feedback to start designing games.  

Design Thinking Exercise: Pass out the sheets, play three games on the Hyperpad app, take some notes on what you like and don't like about each game.  

### Level Design  

Ask, what makes a good level? Traps, collectibles, enemies, challenging (but, not too much), etc. Hand out the level design sheets  

### Hyperpad Walkthrough  

Explain, everything in the app is an object. Quickly go over the interface.  

Already have created games with assets.  

* Get a background  

* Turn grid lines on  

* Placing Block Objects
  - snapping them together  

* Main Character Behaviors  
  - controlling character movements  

* Object Collisions  
  - between character and object
